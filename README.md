## Getting Started

This project demonstrates the basics of Flutter development. The following key concepts are covered:

1. **Widgets**  
   Widgets are the building blocks of Flutter applications. They describe the structure of your UI and can be composed to create complex interfaces. 

2. **StatelessWidgets and StatefulWidgets**  
   In Flutter, there are two main types of widgets:
   - **StatelessWidget**: Used when the UI does not need to change dynamically after it is built.
   - **StatefulWidget**: Used when the UI can change in response to user interaction or other factors.

3. **List Collections**  
   Collections are essential for managing lists of data in Flutter. Dart's list data structures are used to hold multiple items that can be displayed in the UI.

4. **ListView and ListView.builder()**  
   The `ListView` widget displays a scrollable list of items. `ListView.builder()` efficiently builds list items on demand, improving performance for large lists.

5. **Making API Calls**  
   Learn how to fetch data from external APIs using HTTP requests. This project demonstrates how to make network calls and handle JSON responses.

6. **Creating Models**  
   Models represent the data retrieved from the API. Youâ€™ll learn how to define model classes to handle structured data and map JSON responses to Dart objects.

7. **Displaying Images with Image.network()**  
   The `Image.network()` widget is used to display images from the internet in the app. This is useful for creating dynamic UIs with remote image sources.
